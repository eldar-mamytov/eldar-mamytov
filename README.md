# Hi, I’m Eldar 👋

Master’s student in Computer Science @ NEIU. I build practical **AI** and **DevOps** projects and ship them end-to-end.

- 🎯 Focus: shipping reliable web apps with clean infra
- 🚀 Goal: DevOps/Platform internship 2025–2026
- 📍 Chicago area (CST)

## DevOps Highlights
- Dockerized services with Docker and Compose for consistent dev/stage.
- Set up CI with GitHub Actions to lint, test, and build on pull requests.
- Automated Linux deployments with Bash and Ansible; managed env vars and secrets.
- Configured Nginx reverse proxy and HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt.
- Implemented logging and metrics via health endpoints and basic Prometheus/Grafana.
- Administered Linux servers and cloud instances; hardened systems with patching, RBAC, and firewall rules.
- Managed SSL/TLS, load balancing, and domain/DNS when needed.

## Toolbelt
- Containers:** Docker, Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions  
- Infra & OS:** Linux, Bash, Ansible, Nginx  
- Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, health checks  
- Backend:** Python FastAPI, Java Spring Boot  
- Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Selected Projects
- **HealthMate-AI** — ML-assisted symptom checker with chat UI. Dockerized, Nginx reverse proxy, CI on GitHub Actions.
